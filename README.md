## Background

![network example](https://github.com/asamallab/RicciCurvature-fMRInetworks/blob/main/readme_image.png)

For the analysis of functional connectivity networks of the human brain, we spatially and temporally preprocess fMRI scans from datasets included in our study, using the CONN toolbox. 
* The functional connectivity matrices and functional connectivity networks for the datasets are available in the fMRInetworks folder.

* The codes that were used in our study and analysis are available in the CODES folder.
