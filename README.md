For the analysis of functional connectivity networks (FCNs) of the human brain, we spatially and temporally preprocess fMRI scans from datasets included in our study, using the MATLAB based CONN toolbox.

* The functional connectivity (FC) matrices and functional connectivity networks (FCNs) for the datasets are available in the [fMRInetworks](https://github.com/asamallab/RicciCurvature-fMRInetworks/tree/main/fMRInetworks) folder. 
* The codes that were used in our study and analysis are available in the [CODES](https://github.com/asamallab/rsfMRI-FCN-ASD/tree/main/CODES) folder.
* The datasets used in our study is from ABIDE-I. ABIDE-I is a shared initiative by 17 individual imaging sites and compiles studies across the globe that provide raw structural and functional magnetic resonance images (MRI) subjects with _**autism spectrum disorders (ASD)**_ and _**age matched healthy controls (HC)**_. When we initiated our study, there were a total of 1112 subjects in ABIDE-I (539 ASD and 573 HC) out of which, we used 820 subjects (395 ASD and 425 HC) for our study. Refer to [fMRInetworks/ABIDE-I](https://github.com/asamallab/rsfMRI-FCN-ASD/tree/main/fMRInetworks/ABIDE-I) for detailed information.
