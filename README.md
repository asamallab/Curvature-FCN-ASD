## Background

![network example](https://github.com/asamallab/RicciCurvature-fMRInetworks/blob/main/readme_image.png)

For the analysis of functional connectivity networks of the human brain, we spatially and temporally preprocess fMRI scans from datasets included in our study, using the MATLAB based CONN toolbox.

* The functional connectivity matrices and functional connectivity networks for the datasets are available in the [fMRInetworks](https://github.com/asamallab/RicciCurvature-fMRInetworks/tree/main/fMRInetworks) folder. The datasets used in our study are,
## ABIDE-I
 ABIDE-I is a shared initiative by 17 individual imaging sites and studies across the globe that provides raw structural and functional magnetic resonance images(MRI) subjects with _**autism spectrum disorders (ASD)**_ and _**age matched healthy controls (HC)**_. The are a total of 1112 subjects in ABIDE-I (535 ASD and x HC) out of which we used 820 subjects (395 ASD and 425 HC) for our study. Refer to fMRInetworks/ABIDE-I  for additional information.

* The codes that were used in our study and analysis are available in the [CODES](https://github.com/asamallab/RicciCurvature-fMRInetworks/tree/main/CODES) folder.
