##Brief description of Supplementary Tables##

**Supplementary Table S1:** Quality assessment and exclusion strategy for the 1112 subjects originally in the ABIDEI
project. First, the subjects with missing anatomical or functional files were excluded. Second, all subjects from the
imaging site Stanford were excluded as it is the only site with spiral image acquisition protocol. Third, all subjects
from the imaging site Leuven-1 were excluded due to unknown repetition times for the functional scans. Fourth, to
assess the quality of the raw images in ABIDE-I, we have used the information on raters’ decisions available from the
Preprocessed Connectome Project (PCP), and the subjects whose raw image quality was described as ‘fail’ by both
the raters were excluded. The raw images of the subjects that survived these exclusions were preprocessed. After
preprocessing the raw fMRI data, we applied the following criteria to exclude participants from the analysis. Subjects
were excluded if the FC distribution deviated significantly from normal distribution, or if the FC distribution showed
a noticeable distance dependence. We additionally excluded subjects that showed a noticeable correlation between
quality control (QC) variables and FC values, or if the QC-FC correlations showed a noticeable distance dependence.
After removing subjects based on these exclusion criteria, we were left with 395 subjects in the ASD group and 425
subjects in the HC group. The subjects that are included in our study are indicated and for the subjects that are
excluded, the reason for exclusion is marked in the respective columns.
